I spent most of the weekend learning new R packages for the R project 5, I found the most interesting one to be gganimate, that i plan to use for future use. Gganimate allows us to plot 
points for charts that reference data over time and allows us to plot the same data in many ways through animating different frames in a datapoint. 

I am very excited to use this feature in project 9 and throughout other learning target checks
