Today I have mostly been working on project 2, the main challenge presented on project two is managing joins between multiple datasets, working on this has been difficult because you need to merge the data 
sets without duplicating columns, and they have different number of rows.  Lastly I will need to add my own customizeable datasets to the program.  It is quite difficult and time
consuming but I am trying to find resources on Youtube to help me
