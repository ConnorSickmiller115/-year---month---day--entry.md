                      Today I reviewed more of merging documents for a project, specifically reviewing old primers to revive my learning on the subject since it has
                      been awhile since i did so.  The trickiest thing is finding out how to merge the files that have the same/ different variables.  I am trying to use the join
                      function in an effort to figure it out.
                      
                      merge(x, y, …)
# S3 method for default
merge(x, y, …)

# S3 method for data.frame
merge(x, y, by = intersect(names(x), names(y)),
      by.x = by, by.y = by, all = FALSE, all.x = all, all.y = all,
      sort = TRUE, suffixes = c(".x",".y"), no.dups = TRUE,
      incomparables = NULL, …)
      
      
          Specifiicaly the "by = intersect" part is giving me the most trouble.
