Today I worked on the learning target check which I think went pretty smoothly, I used filter commands, arrange commands, and a lot of the dplyr package.
I essentially think of the dplyr package as a package that streamlines manipulating data in one code chunk, instead of creating multiple data frames and editing them 
in excel dplyr allows us to manipulate all in one sequence and in one data frame. what I struggled most on was creating the new manipulated columns but eventually I was able
to figure it out with a little help from youtube examples.
