Today the primary  objective was to work with scraping, specifically on IMBD. Scraping is a great tool and I was actually considering using it for our group project, but it seems 
like we dont need to because we have pulled a few data sets.,

A guy called "data slice" has a 4 part series on Youtube that teaches everything you could need on scraping. I linked his channel here
